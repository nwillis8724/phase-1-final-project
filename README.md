# Dani-O-Meter

## Overview
The Dani-O-Meter is a web app that started as a joke between my fiance and I when I joined a coding bootcamp. It still contains a lot of the satire you see in a long-term relationship but I do think it could help those indecisive people in our lives. It asks for a few different things, what kind of mood you are feeling today, your general location, and what activities you enjoy. In turn it will display the appropriate options to take the day on.
