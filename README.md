# Dani-O-Meter

## Overview
The Dani-O-Meter is a web app that started as a joke between my fiance and I when I joined a coding bootcamp. It still contains a lot of the satire you see in a long-term relationship but I do think it could help those indecisive people in our lives. It asks for a few different things, what kind of mood you are feeling today, your general location, and what activities you enjoy. In turn it will display the appropriate options to take the day on.

# Functions
The Dani-O-Meter will have an assortment of functions, the hope is that they all intermingle to make one final product. I imagine that most of these things will change substantially, if not entirely. 

Everything after the three manual imputs will be influenced by whatever has been inputted. perhaps some sort of hide/unhide event after submitting all three will hide the "input" section and show the "Output" section


## Inputs

Weather API
    We will be accessing a Weather API to dictate a lot of the options on the page, for example if its raining it will advise an umbrella for the outfit plan
    
Mood meter
    Utilizing a drop down bar between 1-10 will help the system figure out what general paths to take. for now it will be fairly straight forward - but perhaps we can implement a push system that gives us less motivated individuals a bit extra motivation on those 1 days.

The days vibe
    Productivity level drop-down with string type inputs that range from lazy day to get it done day. As we all know, mood does not decide whether or not we have to go to work... unfortunately.



## Outputs

Meal Plan
    From left overs to the usual to adventurous, maybe impliment some sort of meal of the day that displays a recipie link with ingredients to see if it is fesible 

Clothes
    What to wear. I'm thinking we use a JSON to store a few outfits and even add a submit form to add to the JSON, seperated top(head and torso), bottom(pants), and shoes(shoes)

Social Expectations
    Who should we hang out with today. Make some recomendations based on our inputs. If your are in the 8-10 range on a nice day maybe you go out and meet up with some friends, call someone you havent in a while, or do a hobby project/game night at home, maybe if you are in the 5-7 range you can do a game night or maybe meet up with the people that always bolster your spirits.  If you land in the 1-4 section, we would reccomend you take a treat yourself day. Some times you need a pick-me-up

Songs
    Maybe a playlist, maybe search bar, maybe just based on mood. i would like to have a bar with the title, artist and a play, pause, next, and previous function. but that could prove tough.

Any upcoming events 
    Manually input any sort of event you have upcoming and the page will remind you a day ahead and the day of
